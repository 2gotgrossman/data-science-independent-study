Ensembles are a divide-and-conquer approach used to improve performance. 
The main principle behind ensemble methods is that a group of “weak learners” can 
come together to form a “strong learner”. Each classifier, individually, is a “weak learner,” 
while all the classifiers taken together are a “strong learner”.

Trees and Forests. The random forest starts with a standard machine learning technique called a “decision tree” which, in ensemble terms, corresponds to our weak learner. In a decision tree, an input is entered at the top and as it traverses down the tree the data gets bucketed into smaller and smaller sets. For details see here, from which the figure below is taken.
